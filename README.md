# ZMK Firmware: Personal fork

This is my personal ZMK fork containing various experimental features used in
my [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config/). This branch is up to date
with the latest ZMK upgrade to Zephyr 3.5. A legacy version
of this branch for Zephyr 3.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/urob/zmk/tree/main-3.2).

---

Note that the branch now includes the official mouse PR #2027. If you are updating from an earlier
version with the original mouse PR #778, then the following
adjustments are necessary in your `zmk-config`:

- `&mwh` --> `&msc`
- `MOVE_VERT` --> `MOVE_Y` or `MOVE_LEFT`/`MOVE_RIGHT`
- `MOVE_HOR` --> `MOVE_X` or `MOVE_UP`/`MOVE_DOWN`
- `SCROLL_VERT` --> `MOVE_Y` or `SCRL_UP`/`SCRL_DOWN`
- `SCROLL_HOR` --> `MOVE_X` or `SCRL_LEFT`/`SCRL_RIGHT`

E.g., this is my current [mouse
configuration](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config/blob/main/config/mouse.dtsi)
using the new api.
